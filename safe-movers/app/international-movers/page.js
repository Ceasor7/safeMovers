              Moving Insurance
            </h1>
            <p>
              Marine insurance is strongly advised for sea and air shipments to
              safeguard against unexpected events during transit (although not
              obligatory, we highly recommend considering coverage). <br />
              <br />
              We offer to arrange the insurance for you at a fee, or you can opt
              to go through your own insurer. You’ll need to furnish an itemized
              valued inventory, a copy of your passport, and a copy of the KRA
              PIN.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a standard, all moves conducted by SafeMovers™ are covered by a
              Goods-in-Transit insurance policy that applies throughout Kenya.{' '}
